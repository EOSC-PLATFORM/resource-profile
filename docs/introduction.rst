Introduction
------------

An EOSC Service is an asset made available by means of the EOSC system and
according to the EOSC Rules of Participation to EOSC End-Users to perform a
process useful to deliver value in the context of the EOSC. EOSC Service
has specialization like Data Sources which includes Research Products and
any other asset.

Data sources are EOSC Services and a subclass of EOSC Services whose specific
purpose is to offer deposition, preservation, curation, discovery, access,
and usage statistics functionalities to collections of EOSC Research Products
from a thematic or cross-discipline perspective.

EOSC Data Sources include Repositories, Scientific Databases, Aggregators,
Journal sites, Publisher sites, and Research Information Systems (CRIS).
Data sources store, preserve, and support discovery and access to metadata,
files, and data relative to publications, research data, research software,
and other research products; Data sources can be “hybrid” in terms of content,
as they may offer access to a variety of research products, and in terms of
intended users, and jurisdiction (i.e. target audience).
