EOSC-Profiles for SERVICE
=========================

Service Profiles describe various research services, including compute services, storage services and application services such as analytics.

Note that (as of October 2022), the word “resource” is used in two contexts:
* Generally, to refer to research IT services, catalogues of such services, research products and assets, collections of research products (called Data Sources) and other kinds of resources that are important to EOSC but not yet formally specified with Profiles (e.g. training resources).
* Specifically, referring only to research IT services.

To reduce this confusion, it is under consideration that by March 2023, the Resource Profile will be renamed the “Service Profile”.  Until then, the Resource Profile should only be used to specify research IT services, such as compute, storage and applications.
